<p>
    Hello, my name is <strong> Yukun.LI  </strong> 
    Also, feels free to call me Michael. I am from China and came to Australia in November 2017 when I was 15 years old.  After the half of years study in language school. I become a high school student in Australia. (my high school is Ringwood secondary college.) So if you want to learn some Chinese or any culture of Chinese, just ask every time you need.  I think almost classmates had an experience like VCE. So am I. During 3 years study in high school I have learned too much, and I know a lot of things in Australia. A country with 8000 kilometres away from China.  Even though I miss my family and hometown sometimes, I still feel comfortable in Australia. People are so friendly and kind. That’s my real feeling. I also miss my high school’s friends and teachers. I hope we can meet when I back to Australia. By the way, I am still study in China cause of the COVID-19. So I’m studying online with the time difference of 2 hours.
</p>
<p>
    My favourite sport is soccer, I am a loyal fan of Barcelona football club. Messi is my idol and I fall in love with him when I saw his unbelievable skill in 2014 world cup. Also I’m interesting in computer games such as league of legends. Also. Singing. I even wanted to choose the major in music hah. But finally, I choose IT.

    <h3 style="color: red; font: size 200%;">Interest in IT</h3>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> •	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </strong></p> 
    <p>As I said, I like play computer games. So I usually image if a can product one game in the future. But I never go through the area of the IT and no deep research for it. Therefore, IT is just a high interest and a lot of areas in my eyes. This kind of thought around in my mind until I came to high school. I remember when I was in year 10, those classes were allocated by school and I had a chance to study IT. At the first time when I come into the IT classroom, I was so interested. So basically, the person that sparked my interest was my IT teacher. He taught us how to use “unity” and let us live the league of legend. All in all, I start to feel interested in IT at that moment. </p>
    
    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> •	Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </strong></p>
    <p>This is a nice question. Why did I choose to come to RMIT.  The most important reason is the environment of the school. I like the design of RMIT’s building and school ground. They are so multi-element and fashion. That’s the point I was attracted by RMIT. I have other reason, like the VCE score and the arrange with my friend, come to RMIT together. So I choose to come to RMIT when I finish the high school.</p>
    
    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> •	What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </strong></p>
    <p>During the study in the major of IT, I expect to learn how to use the information of the IT to improve my skill to use computer. And the knowledge of programming, the information of the computer design and so on. Just want to improve my understand in this area to find a new way in the future life.</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</strong></p>
    <p>The Machine learning engineer is my Ideal Job. Which aimed at delivering machine learning systems for challenging real-world problems that will make a difference in people's daily lives. There are a lot of points that it attracts me. The first is that one of my dreams is to produce one robot or some product can talk with animals in the future. I know it’s not easy to realize. So I need to do deeply research for it. AIML is the largest computer vision and machine learning group in Australia. I can get help. Also AIML is Australia’s leading research institute in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision. Which it with the world-leading researchers, modern facilities and an innovative culture. I think my product idea can join it and be researched through it. what’s more, it can provide Visa sponsorship for me if I can get this machine learning engineer job.</p>  
    
    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</strong></p>
    <p>In order to get this job, I should follow these requirements. 
        More than three years of the experience in commercial software development and the desire to gain experience in product management.
        The experience in a commercial programming language and experience in a data science programming language and toolchain 
        The enough ability to influence and inspire people and with the high communication skills, to show your work and what you study.
        </p>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </strong></p>
    <p>Because this is my first year in the university, as a student, I only get a bit of knowledge during this month after I start to study my major of IT. So I learnt some of knowledge of creating the website and programming. For example, the surface study of Java and python. Comparing to the requirement of this job, I have to learn too much. However, I study business and economic during high school, so I got interpersonal skills. The enough ability to communicate with workmates and our clients. But I know that is not enough.</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can. </strong></p>
    <p>The first thing to do is to improve my academic knowledge during studying in university. That is most important because no one will receive you without a high recognition. This means I have to hard-study and finish all the work in university. Like Java, User design and computer system and more and more cognition of IT. Then I am able to graduate smoothly and get my academic certificate. All of these are basically need if I want to obtain this job. Moreover, I have to increase the skills to use these knowledges I learnt. Try to find some part-time jobs or make some little product. Especially the software things. It will be perfect if I can find any part-time jobs to improve myself and get some experience of the product management. These are my plan.</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> • What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong></p>
    <p>Bases on these three tests, I can get some feature of me. I’m an active people and can not always don’t do anything. I would like to act instead of thinking. But this study in IT is a lesson that needs a lot of patients. So it’s a challenge for me if I want to go through it deeply. Moreover, the creative score shows me should be use my mind in a high frequency, do not always learn from someone’s work. Try more research and work by myself. So that I can improve my creative ability. I should be a flexible student not a rigid one. </p>
    
    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> • How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></p>
    <p>I think as a person with a high active blood, I want to influence my teammates to become a action team. For example, if we can’t figure out any idea or solve problem. We can stop what we doing and go out to have fun. I think the relax is also important in some of area. Especially IT, the exceed work with loss of activity is meaningless. When you feel tired, just have a rest. This is definitely worth. Because idea is everywhere, if we can’t pass in the old way. Just go find other ways. Idea will appear too. But everything has two sides, if the relax is exceed, people could be lazy. That’s I don’t want to see.</p>
    
    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> • How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></p>
    <p>When I form a team, I think I have to concern the creative of the whole team. Account to these tests, I should be a manager of the team. But it is not suitable to be a “brain” of a team. This is my shortcoming so I need to some teammate with a clam mind to make decision that we can create a perfect team. The communicate with people is my strength. I can organize different people to work as a team. </p>

    <h6 style="color:red;font-size:200%;">Project idea-Doraemon Earphone</h6>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong>  Overview </strong></p>
    <p>My product idea was called Doraemon earphones which is an animal translate earphones. Yes, you hear me right. Doraemon! The famous cat robot with the “Treasure bag”. Of course you may say I’m dreaming when I want to product a Doraemon. But my product idea is one of the objects in his bag. And can be realized—animals translate earphones. When people take it up, they can hear the animals’ voice through this Doraemon earphones. It’s not so easy to realize it in a few of years, because there are hundreds and thousands of kinds of animals in our world. So the first of our aims is to realize this work on our pet. Like dogs and cats. Doesn’t that sound nice when people can understand our pet?</p>
     
    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> Motivation - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful.</strong></p>
    <p>The motivation of my product idea was appeared when I was young. I trust everyone watched the cartoon when they were young. Doraemon is my favourite cartoon, even when I am adult now. His can always get a lot of interest objects from his “Treasure bag” and these objects are so interested to me. The most one is the animal translate earphones. When he takes it up, he can understand the mean of the animals through their voice. It’s so interested to me. I like animals so much and I know it’s difficult to chat with them in voice. People usually use hand language instead of voice. But using this earphone, at least we can understand what animals thinking and what they want. It helps us to build a strong relationship between animals and us. </p>

    <p style="color:teal;"><strong> Description - Detailed description of the features of the product or service </strong></p>
    <p>The features of the product is similar the normal translate earphone even the Bluetooth Wireless Headset like airpods that we use in daily. The most difference is this translate earphone contain a special chip that operate the translate work in the communication. It would identify the language of animals then send it to earphone. Now we can get it.
        People always say, “animals are our friends.” So communication is so important between friends. Or we usually do something wrong with a right heart. That’s why we should to product my Doraemon earphones to help us when we want to make real friends with animals. 
        Once the Doraemon earphones were produced. The first place that it should service is the Animal research centre. For example, we all know panda is kind of the rare animals in the world. Even though our zoologists did a lot of work to keep the speed of the number of pandas decrease. It still less and less now. NOT only panda, but there are too many kinds of animals also face this situation.  So it is necessary and urgent to understand what exactly they need. How to keep their live with human. If animals disappear, human will be the second. That is not joke. Back to the topic, once the Doraemon was used in the research centre by zoologists, it would make a lot of works. For example, we can save much time to know animals’ habit, comfortable diet and how does the change of temperature will influence them. We don’t need to waste a lot of time to do test again and again. Moreover, in order to increase the number of these rare animals, zoologists have tried again and again to help their reproduction. But the work is not enough. Nothing can compare to the directly dialogue, is right? So they can use Doraemon earphones to help our true friends to “product more friends”.  Above are my best expect to see in the future. However, I know it is not easy because animal’s language is hard to get. Because we are human, we still have a bit of distance between them. But how about our pet? Our dogs and cats, they stay with us every day. We can say that we don’t have any distance. Even we don’t know their language but they can get what us means sometimes. So this is much easier to realize the communicate by Doraemon earphones. Imaging when your cat makes the voice, “Meow, Meow…”. You hear “I’m so hungry my friend” from the earphone. Or you hear “I should take a bath, dude.” When your dog makes, “Wang, Wang…” it’s so amazing. Right? I hope one day I can understand what my dog’s need and his emotion’s change. Because dogs are same as human. They all get mood and emotions. 
        </p>

     <p style="color:teal;"><strong> Tools and Technologies - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate. </strong></p>
     <p>It’s a real question that we will face to. In order to realize my product idea, what tools and technologies should I use. Actually, I don’t have many ideas about it. I think before we product this earphone, we can try this technology by some application. Then I have to learn the knowledge of development of application. So I need some tools like MySQL, it stores the data in different tables instead of a big storehouse, we will need to collect a lot of date when me compare to the language of animals. </p>
     
     <p style="color:teal;"><strong> Skills Required - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required? </strong></p>
     <p>In order to collect all the information of animal’s language that we need. We have to learn how to program different code to save the information. Then once the voice come into the earphone, the chip will work and identify their exactly information contained in their voice. It required different program skills like Java, C# object-oriented, data structure, Query advanced programming, JAVA object-oriented programming, J2EE server-side advanced programming. And so many of skills I can not list now. otherwise, we also need to do a lot of research by the help of zoologist.</p>
    
     <p style="color:teal;"><strong> Outcome - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</strong></p>
     <p>Once this Doraemon earphone was realized. It will create a big success on the research in animals’ areas. The problem of the Extinction of animals could be solve as their reproduction can be improve. Also it helps the improvement of our environment of world. That’s a macroscopic impact that this product can influent. Partially, the number of stray cats and dogs will reduce, in China, there are so many cats and dogs don’t have a home and they can not live without food and cares. This a normal situation in every city. I hope this outcome will happen which is people would like to adopt these pitiful dogs and cats as our pet. This Doraemon even can be free for them. Furthermore, I hope my earphone can reduce the indiscriminate killing of animals in our world.  </p>
